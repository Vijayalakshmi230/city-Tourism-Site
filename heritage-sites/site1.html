    <h4>Adalaj Stepwell</h4>
    <p>
        The temple is dedicated to Harshat Mata, the village's goddess of joy and happiness. 
        According to folklore, this massive stepwell, which has 3500 steps and 13 stories,
        was built in just one night! Because that is an impossible feat for even a superhuman, 
        the locals believe the structure was built by a djinn, a spirit.
