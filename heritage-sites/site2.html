    <h4>Buland Darwaza</h4>
    <p>
        Buland Darwaza, or the "Door of victory", was built in 1575 by Mughal emperor Akbar 
        to commemorate his victory over Gujarat. It is the main entrance to the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri, 
        which is 43 km from Agra, India. Buland Darwaza is the highest gateway in the world and is an example of Mughal architecture. 
        It displays sophistication and heights of technology in Akbar's empire.
