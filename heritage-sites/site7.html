    <h4>Qutub-Minar</h4>
    <p>
        Built in the early 13th century a few kilometres south of Delhi, the red sandstone tower
         of Qutb Minar is 72.5 m high, tapering from 2.75 m in diameter at its peak to 14.32 m 
         at its base, and alternating angular and rounded flutings. The surrounding archaeological 
         area contains funerary buildings, notably the magnificent Alai-Darwaza Gate, the masterpiece
          of Indo-Muslim art (built in 1311), and two mosques, including the Quwwatu'l-Islam, the oldest 
          in northern India, built of materials reused from some 20 Brahman temples.
